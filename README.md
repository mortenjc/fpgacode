# fpgacode

Early experiments with writing FPGA code in systemverilog.

## cpu
An early attempt at building up a risc-type cpu. This is currently
at a very early stage and not at all usable.

## microcode
Code implemented based on a youtube series attempting to build a microcode
cpu for playing Zork. Unfortunately the project didn't finish so this is
incomplete. However I learned about writing C++ unit tests for functional
verification.

## anspwm
Code for doing pulse width modulation for a specific application.

## quartus
Intel Quartus Prime project files (becoming obsolete)
