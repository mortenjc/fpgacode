# fpgacode

Early experiments with writing FPGA code in systemverilog.

## cpu
An early attempt at building up a risc-type cpu. This is currently
at a very early stage and not at all usable.

## microcode
Code implemented based on a youtube series attempting to build a microcode
cpu for playing Zork. Unfortunately the project didn't finish so this is
incomplete. However I learned about writing C++ unit tests for functional
verification.

## quartus
Using Intel's Quartus Prime lite IDE for writing systemverilog for the DE10-lite
FPGA demo board from terasic.
