# DE10-lite FPGA Clock
This project uses the DE10-lite FPGA demo board from
terasic which sports a MAX10 FPGA from Altera.

This project was built using Intel's Quartus Prime lite IDE.

The clock uses DE10's six 7-segment display LEDs to show the 24h clock in
the hhmmss format. The decimal dots blinks at 2 Hz.

The clock can be set using the right most five or six switches. Pressing the
top button sets the hours and pressing the bottom button sets the minutes.
